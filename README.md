## Hi, I'm Shaantanu Iyengar 👋
I’m an **Electronics Engineering with Space Science & Technology** student, passionate about **AI/ML, Embedded Systems, and intelligent hardware–software integration**. My goal is to design **efficient, intelligent systems** by bridging the gap between computation and physical hardware. Through my experience at **Leonardo’s Electronic Warfare Site** and university/personal projects, I’ve developed strong skills in:
### 🔹 AI & Machine Learning  
- **PyTorch**  
- Model development, training pipelines
### 🔹 Hardware & FPGAs  
- **SystemVerilog, Microprocessor Design**  
- ALU design, VGA controllers, digital logic implementation
### 🔹 Embedded Systems  
- **Arduino, C++, Sensor Integration**  
- Real-time hardware–software interfacing
### 🔹 System Debugging & Integration  
- Hardware–software co-verification  
- Performance optimisation, **logical fault-finding**
### 🔹 PCB & CAD Design  
- **OrCAD, KiCad, AutoCAD**  
- Multi-layer PCB schematics, layout design, 3D modelling
### 🔹 Simulation & Data Analysis  
- **MATLAB** for algorithm development, modelling, and system simulation
