### Hi there, I'm Shaantanu Iyengar 👋

I'm an Electronics Engineering with Space Science and Technology student, **passionate about the full tech stack — from AI models to chip design.**

My goal is to build intelligent, efficient systems by bridging the gap between hardware and software. My work experience at Leonardo's Electronic Warfare Site and my personal projects have given me experience in:

* **🤖 AI & Machine Learning:** (PyTorch, LSTM Autoencoders, Anomaly Detection)
* **⚙️ Hardware & FPGAs:** (SystemVerilog, Microprocessor Design, ALU/VGA Controllers)
* **📡 Embedded Systems:** (Arduino, C++, Sensor Integration, Hardware-Software Interfacing)
* **🧪 System Debugging & Integration:** (Hardware-software co-verification, Performance optimization, **Logical fault-finding**)

### 🚀 My Projects

* **🛰️ [AI-Based Satellite Anomaly Detector](https://github.com/ShaantanuIyengar/-AI-Based-Satellite-Anomaly-Detector-)** *(Currently Building)*
    * Developing a Python-based AI to detect thermal/electrical anomalies in real-time satellite telemetry (from NASA's open datasets).
    * Training an LSTM autoencoder in PyTorch.
    * **Implementing fault-detection logic** to handle noisy or missing telemetry data streams.
    * Building a Streamlit dashboard to visualize live alerts from hardware.

* **👾 [FPGA-Based Microprocessor System](https://github.com/ShaantanuIyengar/fpga-microprocessor)**
    * Designed and implemented a custom microprocessor on an FPGA using SystemVerilog.
    * Built key components from scratch, including an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), Register File, and VGA controller.
    * Implemented an assembly-level instruction set, **debugging and verifying** correct operations (ALU, Register File) through switch/LED interaction and VGA display output.

* **📡 [180-Degree Ultrasonic Radar System](https://github.com/ShaantanuIyengar/arduino-radar-system)**
    * Engineered a radar system using an Arduino and ultrasonic sensor.
    * Developed C++ code for hardware-software interfacing.
  * **Diagnosed and calibrated** sensor offset to improve measurement precision from +-10 cm to +-6 cm, **addressing errors caused by signal reflections.**

### 💼 My Experience

* **Work Experience Placement @ Leonardo (Summer 2023)**
    * Worked with a cross-functional team to design and prototype a proximity sensor system.
    * Formulated a reliable test plan, **iteratively debugging and optimising** the system's performance to improve detection range by **20%** and response time by **23%**.
