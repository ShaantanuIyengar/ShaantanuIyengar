### Hi there, I'm Shaantanu Iyengar 👋

I'm an Electronics Engineering with Space Science and Technology student, **passionate about the full tech stack — from AI models to chip design.**

My goal is to build intelligent, efficient systems by bridging the gap between hardware and software. My work experience at Leonardo's Electronic Warfare Site and my personal projects have given me experience in:

* **🤖 AI & Machine Learning:** (PyTorch, LSTM Autoencoders, Anomaly Detection)
* **⚙️ Hardware & FPGAs:** (SystemVerilog, Microprocessor Design, ALU/VGA Controllers)
* **📡 Embedded Systems:** (Arduino, C++, Sensor Integration, Hardware-Software Interfacing)
* **🧪 System Debugging & Integration:** (Hardware-software co-verification, Performance optimization, **Logical fault-finding**)

### 🚀 My Projects

* **🛰️ [AI-Based Satellite Anomaly Detector](https://github.com/ShaantanuIyengar/-AI-Based-Satellite-Anomaly-Detector-)** *(Currently Building)*
    * Developing a Python-based AI to detect thermal/electrical anomalies in real-time satellite telemetry (from NASA's open datasets).
    * Training an LSTM autoencoder in PyTorch.
    * **Implementing fault-detection logic** to handle noisy or missing telemetry data streams.
    * Building a Streamlit dashboard to visualize live alerts from hardware.

* **👾 [FPGA-Based Microprocessor System](
